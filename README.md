# NILTS
A game about many things. I don't know what, since most content is randomly generated.

## What is NILTS?

Welcome to the git repository for NILTS. NILTS is a procedurally generated RPG/roguelike that introduces various mechanics inspired by such games as Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft and Nethack. Unlike the latter, movement is neither restricted to a grid not restricted to two dimensions. NILTS will eventually attempt to introduce artifically intelligence NPCs that change as time goes on, creating a dynamic and fun game that can involve the player for many hours.

## Current features

Of course, there's a reason this is on github. Most notably because it's not finished yet. At the moment, the following are functional:

- Core engine
- Basic world generation
- Basic NPCs
- Basic player character
- Movement, momentum and mass

## Features currently in development

There are several features currently being developed:

- Items and inventory system
- Intelligent NPCs
- Memory leak fixes
- Saving / loading of worlds
- More advanced world / terrain generation
- Improved texture loading system
- Improved resource management system

## Compiling

There is a x86_64 binary included in this repository, but if you wish to compile NILTS yourself, you can download and compile it as below:

`git clone git://github.com/zesterer/nilts.git`
`cd nilts`
`sh cmd_to_compile.sh`

Then, simply run NILTS with:

`./nilts`

## FAQ

### Why the name 'NILTS'?

'NILTS' is an acronym for 'New and Improved Leon Trotsky Simulator', first beginning as an inside joke between a friend and myself. I grew to like the name, and have since adopted it as the permanent name for the project. Ironically, NILTS is not new, improved, or a simulator. And it most definitely has nothing to with Leon Trotsky.

### What features are on the roadmap?

Simple answer: I don't know. I'm not the kind of person to create plans. I do have a roadmap, but it's very subject to change so there's not much point putting it here. If you want features in development, see above.

### How do I compile it?
